This is a Julia plugin and code generator to generate your own client library with Swagger.

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.

Check out [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more.

## How do I use this?

### Building

To build the project, run this:

```
plugin/build.sh
```

A single jar file (julia-swagger-codegen-0.0.1.jar) will be produced in `plugin/target`.

You can now use that for codegen.

### Code Generation:

Use the supplied script `plugin/generate.sh` and point it to the specification file and a configuration file. E.g.:

```
${SWAGGERDIR}/plugin/generate.sh -i ${SPECDIR}/${SPECFILE} -o ${GENDIR} -c config.json
```

The configuration file (`config.json`) can have the following options:

- `packageName`: the Julia package to generate (`SwaggerClient` by default)
